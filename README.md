## Who is it for?
- You _really_ don't like graphical applications or are working on a computer without graphical capabilities.
- You are looking for a quick way to convert any visual media to ASCII art.
- You want to watch a video in the terminal, but you don't want to use `mpv` or `vlc` because they're too mainstream.
- You like ASCII art so much that you don't need sound to enjoy a good movie.
- You want to show off your terminal skills to your friends and make them think you're a hacker.

## Features
- [x] Converts and shows any media to ASCII art in the terminal
- [x] Supports images/gifs/videos/webcam and YouTube links
- [x] Any resolution, aspect ratio, and framerate
- [x] Use any character set as supported by your terminal
- [x] Handy pause/unpause and char map selection [controls](#playback-commands)
- [ ] Colors (not yet!)
- [ ] Sound (not yet!)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Being a Rust crate, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The following dependencies are also required:
[OpenCV 4](https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust#getting-opencv)

Optional dependency for YouTube support: [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/installation)

## Development:
You may need to install the following packages on some Linux distributions:
`libssl-dev` (to run tests)
`libopencv-dev`
`libstdc++-12-dev`
`gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
 `clang libclang-dev`

## Installation

A step-by-step guide on how to set up the project for development or usage.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maxcurzi/tplay.git

# Change to the project directory
cd tplay

# (optional) Build the project
cargo build

# (optional) Run the tests
cargo test

# Run the project (use --release for faster performance)
cargo run --release -- <media> [options]
```

You can install the `tplay` command line tool by running the following command:

```bash
# Install the tplay command line tool
cargo install tplay
```
So that you can run it from anywhere as
```bash
# Install the tplay command line tool
tplay <media> [options]
```
## Usage
`tplay <media> [options]`

| Argument | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `media` | Name of the file or stream to be processed (required). |
| `-f`, `--fps` | Maximum frames per second for the output (default: 60). |
| `-c`, `--char_map` | Custom lookup character table to use for the output (default: ` .:-=+*#%@`). |
| `-w`, `--w_mod` | Experimental width modifier for certain characters such as emojis (default: 1). Use a value of 2 if your char_map is composed of emojis. |


```bash
# Run it (use `cargo run --release --` if you didn't install it as tplay)
tplay <media> [options]

# Example: local image
tplay ./image.png

# Example: local gif
tplay ./image.gif

# Example: local video
tplay ./video.mp4 --fps 60

# Example: remote video (YouTube)
tplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --fps 30

# Example: remote video (Other)
tplay http://media.developer.dolby.com/Atmos/MP4/shattered-3Mb.mp4 --fps 30

# Example: YouTube video - 30fps, with different char maps
tplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fShlVhCfHig --fps 30 --char-map " ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà"

# Example: YouTube video - 30fps, with different char maps (use w-mod to adjust width when using emoji-based char maps)
tplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8 --fps 30 --char-map "üçéüçè‚ù§Ô∏èüòä" --w-mod 2

# Example: webcam on Linux (YMMV on other OSes)
tplay /dev/video0 --fps 30
```

## Playback commands
- `space` - pause/unpause
- `q` - quit
- `0-9` - change char map

## Known Issues
- Videos played through the Konsole terminal may have reduced performance. This is due to the way Konsole handles terminal output. If you experience this issue, try using a different terminal emulator.

## Alternatives
A lot of people have made their own ASCII video players:

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
Ideally I'd like to implement the following features:
- Colors
- Sound playback
- More media controls (forward, backward, loop, etc.)

Let me know if you have any other ideas!

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Why?
_Your Scientists Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could, They Didn‚Äôt Stop To Think If They Should_

Mostly did it for fun while learning Rust. I also wanted to see if it was possible to make a video player that could run in the terminal. I think it's pretty cool that you can play videos in the terminal now. I hope you enjoy it too!
