View images, videos, webcam, etc directly in the terminal as ASCII. All images you see [below](#features) are just made by characters on the terminal command line, drawn really fast.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Being a Rust crate, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

The following dependencies are also required:
[OpenCV 4](https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust#getting-opencv), [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-16.0.0)

 Optional dependency for YouTube support: [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/installation)

## Prerequisites Installation on Linux
If you're on Linux, you can install OpenCV (and the required Clang) with your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev clang libclang-dev
```

## Prerequisites installation on Windows
If you have troubles installing OpenCV in Windows (I know I have) try this (assuming you have a relatively modern computer with a Windows 64bit installation):
- Download OpenCV prebuilt binaries (I used this [one](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/)) and it was 4.6.0 at the time of writing.
- Open the package and extract the `opencv` folder to `C:\opencv` or any other location you prefer.
- Set the following environment variables (update the paths if you extracted the package to a different location):
  - OPENCV_INCLUDE_PATHS = `C:\opencv\build\include`
  - OPENCV_LINK_LIBS = `opencv_world460` (or whatever version you have, for OpenCV 4.7.0 you want `opencv_world470`)
  - OPENCV_LINK_PATHS = `C:\opencv\build\x64\vc15\lib`
  - Also add this to your PATH variable : `C:\opencv\build\x64\vc15\bin`

- Install [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-16.0.0) from binary, you'll likely want to use the 64-bit version on a modern computer.
  - Add this to your PATH variable (or whatever corresponding directory you have on your computer): `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`



## Development:
You may need to install the following packages on some Linux distributions:
`libssl-dev` (to run tests)
`libopencv-dev`
`libstdc++-12-dev`
`gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
 `clang libclang-dev`

## Installation

A step-by-step guide on how to set up the project for development or usage.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maxcurzi/tplay.git

# Change to the project directory
cd tplay

# (optional) Build the project
cargo build

# (optional) Run the tests
cargo test

# Run the project (use --release for faster performance)
cargo run --release -- <media> [options]
```

You can install the `tplay` command line tool by running the following command:

```bash
# Install the tplay command line tool
cargo install tplay
```
So that you can run it from anywhere as
```bash
# Install the tplay command line tool
tplay <media> [options]
```
## Usage
`tplay <media> [options]`

| Argument | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `media` | Name of the file or stream to be processed (required). |
| `-f`, `--fps` | Maximum frames per second for the output (default: 60). |
| `-c`, `--char_map` | Custom lookup character table to use for the output (default: ` .:-=+*#%@`). |
| `-g`, `--gray` | Start in grayscale mode |
| `--w_mod` | Experimental width modifier for certain characters such as emojis (default: 1). Use a value of 2 if your char_map is composed of emojis. |


```bash
# Run it (use `cargo run --release --` if you didn't install it as tplay)
tplay <media> [options]

# Example: local image
tplay ./image.png

# Example: local gif
tplay ./image.gif

# Example: local video
tplay ./video.mp4 --fps 60

# Example: remote video (YouTube)
tplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --fps 30

# Example: remote video (Other)
tplay http://media.developer.dolby.com/Atmos/MP4/shattered-3Mb.mp4 --fps 30

# Example: YouTube video - 30fps, with different char maps
tplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fShlVhCfHig --fps 30 --char-map " ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà"

# Example: YouTube video - 30fps, with different char maps (use w-mod to adjust width when using emoji-based char maps)
tplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8 --fps 30 --char-map "üçéüçè‚ù§Ô∏èüòä" --w-mod 2

# Example: webcam on Linux (YMMV on other OSes)
tplay /dev/video0 --fps 30
```

## Playback commands
- `space` - pause/unpause
- `q` - quit
- `0-9` - change char map
- `g` - toggle grayscale/color

## Known Issues
- Videos played through the Konsole terminal may have reduced performance. This is due to the way Konsole handles terminal output. If you experience this issue, try using a different terminal emulator.
- Media playback is cpu-intensive. To improve performance, try lowering the `fps` value, increase font size, or reduce the terminal window size.

## Alternatives
This is my ASCII media player: _there are many like it, but this one is mine._

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request.
Ideally I'd like to implement the following features:
- Sound playback (both audio track of videos and audio files)
- More media controls (forward, backward, loop, etc.)
- Any suggestions to improve the installation experience on Windows (Installing and setting up OpenCV is non-trivial)

Let me know if you have any other ideas!

## Why?
_Your Scientists Were So Preoccupied With Whether Or Not They Could, They Didn‚Äôt Stop To Think If They Should_

Mostly did it for fun while learning Rust. I also wanted to see if it was possible to make a video player that could run in the terminal. I think it's pretty cool that you can play videos in the terminal now. I hope you enjoy it too!
